Team 14 chose to do a function-oriented design programming paradigm for the design of our 
prototype for project 3. For project 3 our team decided to create a program that will 
suggest certain drink based on the liquor you have or want to use. We decided to break 
the design into different functioning parts. For example, we have compare.js and 
recommendDrink.js. compare.js takes the alcohol the user chose and searches the array 
storing the ingredients for the drinks and saves the drinks that the liquors match. The 
function is to find matching drinks. recommendDrinks.js takes the time that the user is 
using the liquor cabinet program and makes a suggestion of the drink the user could make.
The focus for the project is on the comparison and display which is not dependent on the 
drink class and attributes.
Although the majority of our project is function-oriented design there is some 
object-oriented design also present. The majority of our project revolves around searching 
and displaying drinks. To make the drinks easier to work with we created a drink class. 
This allows the creation of drink classes that can have more complex attributes like the 
drink name, the alcohols, and the non-alcoholic ingredients. The focus is solely on the 
drink information not how the drink data will be used or displayed. 
JavaScript is a somewhat unique language since it offers the ability to code imperatively
with object-oriented design and/or declaratively with function-oriented design. This
allowed our team flexibility in how we wanted to do the design and lay out of our project 
behind the scenes.
